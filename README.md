# MMAE513

Contains projects and homework from graduate level turbulence class

MMAE513_midterm1.m uses the data from signals.m to create a Probability Density Function graph of flow velocities measured by five sensors at different points along a flow. The script also calculates several statistical values from the signals.m data including mean velocity, fluctuation, variance, and standard deviation.
